Managing Swappiness in ubuntu/kubuntu

Depending upon your settings of swappiness, ubuntu might use the swap space even if there is enough RAM left. The use of swap space can cause a huge performance lag since every now and then the system has to read/write data from/to swap space that is in hard disk.
Here are simple tricks to get out of such situation.
# An immediate solution: Clear swap space (moves data from swap to memory)

$ sudo swapoff -a
$ sudo swapon -a

# A temporary solution: Reduce the swappiness (lost on reboot)

$ sudo sysctl vm.swappiness=5

# A permanent solution: Reduce the swappiness

$ sudo kate /etc/sysctl.conf
or
$ sudo gedit /etc/sysctl.conf

Search for vm.swappiness, and change it to desired value

vm.swappiness=5
