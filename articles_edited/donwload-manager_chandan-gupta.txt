File downloads often face a lots of problems varying from temporary interruption of download to failed downloads and/or corrupted files from downloads. For places with slow internet connection, this becomes so habitual that it becomes a part of our online life. This problem becomes severe when you are dowloading large files like the DVD iso for the recent release of your favourite GNU/Linux distro. To ease your problem, we're brining to you a list of some of the best download managers labeled with their distinct features.Choose yours and get started.


Generic Features of Download Managers
======================================
        Pausing the downloading of large files.
        Resuming broken or paused downloads (especially for very large files).
        Downloading files on poor connections.
        Downloading several files from a site automatically according to simple rules (file types,updated files, etc. - see also Offline Browser).
        Automatic recursive downloads (mirroring).
        Scheduled downloads (including, automatic hang-up and shutdown).
        Searching for mirror sites, and the handling of different connections to download the same
        file more quickly (Segmented downloading).

Wget
======
Wget is a network utility to retrieve files from the Web using http(s) and ftp, the two most widely used Internet protocols. It works non-interactively, so it will work in the background, after having logged off. The program supports recursive retrieval of web-authoring pages as well as ftp sites — you can use wget to make mirrors of archives and home pages or to travel the Web like a WWW robot.
Wget works particularly well with slow or unstable connections by continuing to retrieve a document until the document is fully downloaded. Re-getting files from where it left off works on servers (both http and ftp) that support it. Both http and ftp retrievals can be time stamped, so wget can see if the remote file has changed since the last retrieval and automatically retrieve the new version if it has.
Wget supports proxy servers; this can lighten the network load, speed up retrieval, and provide access behind firewalls.
Wget is a default download manager for Ubuntu . Therefore you do not need to install it again.


Gwget

Axel
=====
Axel is a command-line downloader for unix-like operating systems. Unlike wget, axel includes download acceleration, which is achieved by using multiple connections for downloading the file. Starting from version 0.97, the program can use multiple mirrors for one download as well. The program tries to be as light as possible (25-30k in binary form), so it might be useful as a wget clone on byte-critical systems.
